# DD2423-Image-Analysis-and-Computer-Vision-Projects
Project assigments of Image Analysis and Computer Vision Projects course at KTH 

That repository contains the related project assignments which were implemented in KTH's course called Image Analysis and Computer Vision. The topics of the projects can be listed as in the following:

Project 1: Filtering operations
-Observation of Images in spatial and frequency domain.
-Basic operations on the images such as rotation, scaling
-Filtering Operations for smoothing noisy images with filters such as gaussian filter, ideal low-pass filter, and median filter.
-Combination of smoothing and subsampling

Project 2: Edge detection & Hough transform
- Difference Operators
- Gradient Magnitude Thresholding
- Differential Geometry Based Edge Detection
- Edge Extraction and Hough Transform

Project 3: Image segmentation
-K-means Clustering Algorithm
-Mean-Shift Segmentation
-Segmentation with Normalized Cuts
-Segmentation with Graph Cuts

Each project folder contains related question and answer sheets for the project assignments and the matlab code used in the project.
